### Plot expense costs

This repository exists for one reason: next year, my mother will
ask me to create an updated version of this figure.

Would this have been faster to do in excel? Yes.
But at this moment, I don't have an Excel license, but I
do know how to make good looking figures with matplotlib.
The upside is, when I need to remake the figure next year,
it will be easy.
